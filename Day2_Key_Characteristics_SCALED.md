## 🎯 Welcome to Day 2!

Yesterday, we learned *why* System Design matters. Today, we learn *what* makes a system great.

Introducing the **SCALED Framework** — the 6 superpowers every great system must have. Master these, and you'll think like an architect in every interview.

## 🦸 The 6 Superpowers: SCALED

### S — Scalability
> **Can it grow without breaking?**

Scalability is a system's ability to handle increased load by adding resources.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Vertical Scaling** | Add more power to existing machine (CPU, RAM) | Upgrading server from 8GB to 64GB RAM |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Add more machines | Netflix adding more servers during peak hours |

**Interview Question:** *"How would you handle 10x traffic tomorrow?"*

---

### C — Consistency
> **Do all users see the same data at the same time?**

Consistency ensures that every read receives the most recent write.

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Strong Consistency** | All nodes see same data instantly | Banking transactions |
| **Eventual Consistency** | Data syncs eventually, not instantly | Social media likes count |

**Interview Question:** *"Should your system prioritize consistency or availability?"*

---

### A — Availability
> **Is the system always there when you need it?**

Availability is measured in "nines":

| Availability | Downtime/Year | Example |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| 99% (two nines) | 3.65 days | Personal blog |
| 99.9% (three nines) | 8.76 hours | Business apps |
| 99.99% (four nines) | 52.6 minutes | E-commerce |
| 99.999% (five nines) | 5.26 minutes | Banking, Healthcare |

**Interview Question:** *"What's your system's availability target and how will you achieve it?"*

---

### L — Latency
> **Is it fast enough for users?**

Latency is the time taken for a request to travel from client to server and back.

| Latency | User Perception | Example |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| < 100ms | Instant | Google Search |
| 100-300ms | Slight delay | E-commerce checkout |
| 300ms-1s | Noticeable | Acceptable for complex queries |
| > 1s | Frustrating | Users start leaving |

**Amazon's Discovery:** Every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales.

**Interview Question:** *"How would you reduce latency in this system?"*

---

### E — Efficiency
> **Does it use resources wisely?**

Efficiency is about maximizing output while minimizing resource usage (compute, storage, network, cost).

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Throughput** | Requests processed per second |
| **Resource Utilization** | CPU, Memory, Network usage |
| **Cost per Request** | Infrastructure cost per operation |

**Interview Question:** *"How would you optimize this system to reduce costs by 50%?"*

---

### D — Durability
> **Does data stay safe forever?**

Durability ensures that once data is saved, it won't be lost — even during failures.

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Replication** | Store copies across multiple servers |
| **Backups** | Regular snapshots of data |
| **Write-Ahead Logging** | Log changes before applying them |
| **Geo-Redundancy** | Store data across different regions |

**Interview Question:** *"How do you ensure zero data loss in case of a server crash?"*

## ⚠️ The Million-Dollar Insight

Here's what separates junior developers from senior architects:

> **You can't maximize all six superpowers at once. It's a trade-off game.**

Every architectural decision involves choosing which superpowers to prioritize and which to sacrifice.

## 📱 Real-World Example: WhatsApp

Let's see how WhatsApp makes trade-offs:

### What WhatsApp Prioritizes:

| Superpower | Priority | Implementation |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Scalability** | ✅ HIGH | Handles 2+ billion users |
| **Latency** | ✅ HIGH | Messages delivered in milliseconds |
| **Availability** | ✅ HIGH | 99.99% uptime target |
| **Durability** | ✅ HIGH | Messages stored until delivered |

### What WhatsApp Sacrifices:

| Superpower | Priority | Trade-off |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Consistency** | ⚠️ RELAXED | "Seen" tick may appear late; message order occasionally inconsistent |

### Why This Trade-off?

WhatsApp uses **Eventual Consistency**:
- Your message is delivered instantly (low latency)
- The "seen" status syncs a bit later (eventual consistency)
- The app stays responsive even during network issues (high availability)

**This is real-world system design!** They chose to sacrifice *perfect* consistency for *better* availability and latency.

## 🏢 More Real-World Examples

| Company | Prioritizes | Sacrifices | Why |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----|
| **Banking Apps** | Consistency, Durability | Latency | Money must be accurate, even if slightly slow |
| **Netflix** | Availability, Latency | Strong Consistency | Video must play; it's okay if view counts lag |
| **Google Search** | Latency, Availability | Perfect Consistency | Speed matters; index can be slightly stale |
| **Stock Trading** | Consistency, Latency | Cost Efficiency | Every millisecond and cent matters |
| **Instagram** | Availability, Scalability | Consistency | Like counts can be approximate |

## 🎓 How to Use SCALED in Interviews

When designing any system, ask yourself:

### Step 1: Identify Requirements
- "What's the expected scale?" → **Scalability**
- "How fresh must the data be?" → **Consistency**
- "What's acceptable downtime?" → **Availability**
- "What response time is acceptable?" → **Latency**
- "What's the budget?" → **Efficiency**
- "Can we afford data loss?" → **Durability**

### Step 2: Make Trade-offs
State your trade-offs clearly:

> *"For this social media feed, I'll prioritize Availability and Latency over Consistency. Users can tolerate seeing likes count that's a few seconds stale, but they can't tolerate a slow or unavailable feed."*

### Step 3: Justify Your Decisions
Always explain *why* you made each trade-off based on business requirements.

## ✅ Day 2 Action Items

1. **Memorize SCALED** — Use this acronym in every interview
2. **Analyze Apps** — Pick 3 apps you use daily and identify their SCALED trade-offs
3. **Practice Explaining** — "WhatsApp sacrifices consistency for availability because..."
4. **Think Trade-offs** — There's no perfect system, only perfect trade-offs

## 🔜 Coming Up: Day 3

Tomorrow, we dive into **Client-Server Architecture & HTTP Basics** — the foundation of how systems communicate.

We'll explore:
- How clients and servers talk
- HTTP request/response cycle
- REST principles
- Real example: Restaurant ordering system

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> **Great systems aren't about maximizing everything — they're about making the RIGHT trade-offs for the business.**

When an interviewer asks you to design a system, they're not looking for a "perfect" design. They're looking to see if you can:

1. Identify the right superpowers to prioritize
2. Make intelligent trade-offs
3. Justify your decisions

Master SCALED, and you're already thinking like an architect.
